# Retail_Analytics
## Goal
Analyse data from a retailer and predict departement-wide sales for each store.

## Data Source
The data can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset).

If you want to run the code, please note that the files have been renamed (Features data set -> features, sales data-set -> sales, stores data-set -> stores)

## Approach
1. Screen data
2. Transform data (cast datatypes, clean up, select relevant)
3. Join data
4. Define features and categories
5. Index features and build feature vector
6. Create and train model
7. Evaluate Predictions

## Note to Myself
start jupyter from anaconda prompt using "jupyter notebook"
