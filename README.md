# Retail_Analytics
## Goal
Analyse data from a retailer and predict departement-wide sales for each store.

## Data Source
The data can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset).

If you want to run the code, please note that the files have been renamed (Features data set -> features, sales data-set -> sales, stores data-set -> stores)

## Approach
1. Screen data
2. Transform data (cast datatypes, clean up, select relevant)
3. Join data
4. Plot data for feature correlation analysis
5. Choose apropriate model
6. Evaluate predictions

## Note to Myself
start jupyter from anaconda prompt using "jupyter notebook"
