# retail_analytics

## data source
The data can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessgoode/starter-retail-data-analytics-fddf685e-a).

If you want to run the code, please note that the files have been renamed (Features data set -> features, sales data-set -> sales, stores data-set -> stores)

## note to myself
start jupyter from anaconda prompt using "jupyter notebook"
